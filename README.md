# UserDetails
In this project I demonstrate how to enter person's data. 
Like name and age. The object is to demonstrate how the correct data is successfully recorded and the incorrect data is refuted. 
If I accept the system, the system writes. 
If refused opens a pop-up stating that the data is incorrect.
